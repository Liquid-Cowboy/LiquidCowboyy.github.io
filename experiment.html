        <p> Hi! My name's Marcos Teixeira and I'm a 3rd year undergraduate from IPCA's school of design. <a>Since the
        first year of highschool I've been looking forward to develop my skills as an artist and a craftsman,
        looking for formal education outside of the academic environment - in an atelier in my home town "Maia"
        - and doing workshops in which I learned new views on the matters of representation and observation,
        studying under the tutelage of, for example, Glenn Vilppu and Anthony Baus.</p>
